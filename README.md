# RPG-lexer
RPG lexer using xText

This project aims to describe the RPG syntax gramma. To be more precise: After IBM introduced 100% free RPG
it is now possible to use standard lexers like xText  or event use tooling from the LEX,YACC,BISON universe
to parse RPG code. So this project can be used as an academic project for better understanding of the RPG 
language but also for better tooling like plug in for 100% free-RPG editors 
running in i.e. Eclipse with code completion etc.

This implementation is using xText to describe the RPG language as a domain specific language in JAVA.
